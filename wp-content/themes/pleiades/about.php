      <p>I'm the <strong>Director of User Experience</strong> at <strong>Fusion Media</strong>, where I work with Fortune 500s to improve their employees' lives by making internal tools easier to use.</p>
      <p>I'm also the <strong>Managing Editor</strong> of <strong><a href="http://theindustry.cc">The Industry</a></strong>, a digital publication that helped pioneer design-oriented coverage of the startup scene.</p>
      <p>I like to tinker on side projects that combine my disparate areas of interest. My latest project is <strong><a href="http://fivefootshelf.org">FiveFootShelf</a></strong>, which provides curated reading lists for great literature.</p>
      <p>I live in the <strong>Hudson Valley</strong>, a beautiful part of the world just north of New York City. In addition to incredible nature and some of the best food on the planet, we've got a burgeoning tech scene. I wrote a little about the region <a href="http://jordankoschei.com/the-hudson-valley/">here</a>.</p>
      <p>I think a person's <strong>avocations</strong> say more about them than their vocation. As such, it might be helpful for you to know that I enjoy: reading (a lot), cooking, going to museums, winning at <em>Mario Kart</em>, dabbling in screenwriting, and doing stand-up comedy (just once, but I keep telling myself I'll do it again). My particular areas of interest include design, engineering, and economics.</p>
